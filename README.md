# StatusCutter2

It is an another version of [StatusCutter](https://github.com/k1sh0r/StatusCutter), it cuts your (15 seconds) videos for whatsapp and instagram in browser but without a XAMPP server. Instead it uses Flask which means its ideal for running only on own local system. It can also be executed in linux/unix by changing some directories in these files.


There are 3 things needed for this to work
1. Python3 [Download Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Flask framework [Installation instructions](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
3. moviepy python module [Installation instructions](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/install.html)

Setting up
1. Clone this repository to your system
2. Double click or run StatusCutter2.py

The rest is self explanatory I guess.


Thanks to [@vjakash](https://github.com/vjakash) for the UI
